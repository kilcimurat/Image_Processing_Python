- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for interactive image processing
- Examples and demos for each feature

## Requirements

This project requires the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5
- OpenCV
- Pillow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Image

Other project-specific libraries may include:
- hw2Lib

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kilcimurat/Image_Processing_Python.git
    cd Image_Processing_Python
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

You can start the image processing GUI application by running:

```bash
python main.py
```
